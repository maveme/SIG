The Sports Intelligence Lab (SIL) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam advances AI methods for real-world sports. We combine machine learning, computer vision, human-centered AI, and sport science to deliver new insights, tools, and methods that benefit athletes, coaches, and organizations.

#### Mission

To develop transparent, robust, and high-impact AI for sports â€” and to translate research into practical tools that improve performance, health, and decision-making.

#### Vision

An open, interdisciplinary ecosystem where AI augments human expertise in sport, supports fair play, and promotes athlete well-being.
